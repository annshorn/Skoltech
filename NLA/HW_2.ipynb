The rows of matrix $W$ are typically used in NLP tasks (such as computing word similarities) while $C$ is ignored. It is nonetheless instructive to consider the product $W^\\top C = M$. Viewed this way, SGNS can be described as factorizing an implicit matrix $M$ of dimensions $m \\times m$ into two smaller matrices.\n",

Such word-context association matrices are very common in the NLP and word-similarity literature. That said, the objective of SGNS does not explicitly state what this association metric is. What can we say about the association function $f(w,c)$? In other words, which matrix is SGNS factorizing? Below you will find the answers."
