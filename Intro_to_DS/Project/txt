The Respiratory Sound Database was created by two research teams in Portugal and Greece. It includes 920 annotated recordings of varying length - 10s to 90s. These recordings were taken from 126 patients. There are a total of 5.5 hours of recordings containing 6898 respiratory cycles - 1864 contain crackles, 886 contain wheezes and 506 contain both crackles and wheezes. The data includes both clean respiratory sounds as well as noisy recordings that simulate real life conditions. The patients span all age groups - children, adults and the elderly.

This Kaggle dataset includes:

920 .wav sound files
920 annotation .txt files
A text file listing the diagnosis for each patient
A text file explaining the file naming format
